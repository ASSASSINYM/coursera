- Reliable Multicast: the ordering of messages:
    * Lamport like algorithms

- Membership/Failure Detection: the up/down status of a suspected failed process:
    * Gossip

- Leader Election: who the leader is:
    * Paxos
    - Paxos:
        * Safety (two processes dont come to different consensus)
        * Eventual liveness (consensus will be achieved...sometime... or not :-)

- Mutual Exclusion: who has access to the critical resource
